This is a simple desktop client for the [Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) task management service.  It is just an [Adobe Air](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) application that wraps the [RTM iGoogle Gadget](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/igoogle/), built using [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/).  As such, it only offers basic functionality and has no offline-editing facilities.
